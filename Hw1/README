# Overview

This program is a implementation of the text editor Lexi.  This has been implemented
with two main design patterns, Composite and Strategy.  Every class extends (does not
'implement' other than SimpleCompositor implementing Compositor) from root Glyph class,
see UML for visual.  With the use of these strategies once the program runs it will
open a text editor displaying what was prompted inside main.java.
