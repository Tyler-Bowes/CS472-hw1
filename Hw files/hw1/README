# Overview

This program is a implementation of the text editor Lexi.  This has been implemented
with two main design patterns, Composite and Strategy.  Every class extends (does not
'implement' other than SimpleCompositor implementing Compositor) from root Glyph class,
see UML for visual.  With the use of these strategies once the program runs it will
open a text editor displaying what was prompted inside main.java.

# Testing/Test Suit

I first tested some functionality with have single glyphs like rectangles and characters.
After that, rows and columns with children.  As an example of a row with children being
tested through main, I would do something like this inside of main():

    SimpleCompositor simcom = new SimpleCompositor(window);
    Row row1 = new Row(simcom);
    Glyph a = new Character('a');
    Glyph X = new Character('X');
    Glyph b = new Character('b');
    Glyph rect1 = new Rectangle(10, 20);
    
    try {
        row1.addChild(a, 0);
        row1.addChild(rect1, 1);
        row1.addChild(X, 2);
        row1.addChild(b, 3);
    } catch (UnsupportedOperationException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
    window.setContents(row1);

Then to test more, putting columns inside of this.  So, for sake of not putting more lines of
code, I would replace the Character Glyph X with a colum full of X, Y, Z Characters.  And this would
work with the current functionalitly of main.

Then I would put this entire row inside of a column so then I could add another row to the column.
And that is as far as my testing went.

# Other Observations

Currently spacing is "wonky", meaning myprogram, I think what looks like, doubles the spacing for the width
and gives a little less than a full Glyph's height for the height. Other than than that minor spacing problem
functionality of Lexi works fine.

# Compiling 

To compile and run the program go inside the folder with main inside of it.
When you are in the correct folder with main run:

$    javac main.java

to run:

$    java main
